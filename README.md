## PestoLink-Online
*v1.0.0*

PestoLink-Online is a web app designed to run in any browser with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and gamepad support, for example Google Chrome. If you set up an MCU with [PestoLink-Receive](https://github.com/AlfredoSystems/PestoLink-Receive), you can then open PestoLink-Online in a browser, connect to your MCU with BLE, and send gamepad data to the MCU.

PestoLink-Online can also be used to control MicroPython based robots, for example an [XRP Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/22230) by using [PestoLink-MicroPython](https://github.com/AlfredoSystems/PestoLink-MicroPython/tree/main).

This WIP web app is a BLE alternitive to [AlfredoConnect-Desktop](https://github.com/AlfredoElectronics/AlfredoConnect-Desktop)
